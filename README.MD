# Building a portfolio

## Material for Mkdocs 

Material for mkdocs is a very cool static site generator for documentation. It works well and I decided to go static with my portfolio. 

I have used material for mkdocs before on a technical project, but since it is documentation oriented, I didn't think I could make it work as a portfolio, but then I found some examples with a fully overriden home page and I got inspired. 

Example: 
 - [tylerdotrar](https://github.com/tylerdotrar/mkdocs-coverpage)

In the end, I created a completely different home page, but this got me going.

Here we are, out in the wild, my portfolio is available to view as a normal website, but it is also available as an open git repository so other people might get inspired too. 

All of the modifiactions I have made are combinations of my ideas and things I have found on the web, and ofcourse, making them work with the site generator.
