# About me

## Welcome, I am **Anelia**

Digital product designer since 2009 - (She/Her)

I focus on crafting digital products that fulfill your customers’ wildest dreams.

With my extensive experience in UX and UI design, I specialize in identifying software and interface problems. I've dedicated my career to discovering innovative solutions to those problems.

### Behind the scenes

Beyond Interface Design, I am driven by a strong desire to solve problems. I am constantly seeking new approaches in everything that comes my way, not only interface design. The thrill of unraveling complex issues and finding creative solutions fuels my life as a designer.

### Fun stuff

My geeky nature and stubborness enhance my problem-solving skills, bringing a unique perspective and insatiable curiosity to each project. This drive to explore and invent enables me to address software and interface challenges and play with different solutions, until  I find the most suitable one for the situation.

## Hobbies

Outside of work, I find joy in other interests. When I’m not designing interfaces, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, learning how to make different and delightful meals. Cooking has become the place of disconnect that I need, and I take great pleasure in creating delicious and memorable meals.<br>

Additionally, I prioritize my physical and mental well-being, Sometimes going to the gym, doing some yoga, or trying out new fitness activities, staying active and healthy is an essential part of my life.

I find that maintaining this lifestyle not only keeps me energized but also enhances my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
