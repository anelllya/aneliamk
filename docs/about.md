# About me

## Welcome

![Hello, Nice to meet you](img/hello-anelia.webp){ align=left . width="200"}

My name is **Anelia Stoyanova** (She/Her), a digital product designer since 2009.

I have extensive experience in UX and UI design. Specializing in identifying software and interface problems, I dedicate my career to discovering innovative solutions to those problems. I strongly believe that nothing is impossible. <br><br>

Beyond Interface Design, I am driven by a strong desire to solve problems. I am constantly seeking new approaches in everything that comes my way, not only interface design. The thrill of unraveling complex issues and finding creative solutions fuels my life as a designer. <br><br><br><br>

My geeky nature and stubborness enhance my problem-solving skills, bringing a unique perspective and insatiable curiosity to each project. This drive to explore and invent enables me to address software and interface challenges and play with different solutions, until  I find the most suitable one for the situation.<br><br><br><br>

## Hobbies

Outside of work, I find joy in other interests. When I’m not designing interfaces, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, learning how to make different and delightful meals. Cooking has become the place of disconnect that I need, and I take great pleasure in creating delicious and memorable meals.<br>

Additionally, I prioritize my physical and mental well-being, Sometimes going to the gym, doing some yoga, or trying out new fitness activities, staying active and healthy is an essential part of my life.

I find that maintaining this lifestyle not only keeps me energized but also enhances my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
