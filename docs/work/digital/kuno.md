## User Story

**We want** to improve our recently created Online Video Platform, **so that** our content creators from our two online tv channels **can upload and manage** three different types of video content. 

We need to define a clear workflow for the different stages: "*design - development  - stakeholders*", to improve collaboration and predictability of deliverables.

## Goals

1. Improve existing interface (the platform is based on Vuetify 2)
2. Introduce Feature Defintion Development Flow
3. Define and Test Clear User Tasks
4. Maintain a complete Clickable Prototype
5. Create User's Help Center
6. Help with internal documentation

## Feature Definition Flow

In a only one designer team, surrounded by developers, the role of design is not very clear. The person that is responsible for the task is going to have tough time dealing with people not knowing the purpose of design. 

The final goal of feature definition flow is to get to a level where you can anticipate around 80%-95% what is expected to happen and how it will happen, leaving the smallest percentage to simple coincidence. 

Wireframe -------> Prototype -------> Reality

How do we accomplish that? 

In this project we followed these steps. But again, they need to adapt to the actual team work at the company, how the teams communicate and create things, and finally, how they make sure everybody is working on their part of the same project, following the same goal. 

### PRD - Product Requirements Document

When in multidisciplinary meetings people talk without drawing out things on the whiteboard (or any virtual equivalent) everybody leaves with a different idea in their head. It's not a problem when you know that it happens. 

How might we anticipate this? 

We can create a one page Product Requirements Document that is putting black on white what we are commiting to deliver. The whole feature scope, the phases that we estimate it would need to be completed, adapting them to the development team cycles of planning. 

Once the definition meeting has ended and everybody in it had approved the pre-requirements and commitments, there is no place for "You said" "I said" discuccions - it's all written and available for everyone. 

Very good guide you can follow adapting to your needs --> [Atlassian PRD](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements){ target="_blank"}


### Wireframing

Before any design start, we (designers) need to know what is needed. Before coming up with 20 different versions of the same thing, we save a lot of time, gathering ideas from others, most of all because there are countless technical limitations and compromises that can result in wasted time. 

This step is crucial, and I've found that including different people from different parts makes it better. Why? Because not the same people attend all of the meetings, and everybody feels included in the decision making process, which at the end makes the project feel personal to each one of the team members. It's a win-win situation. 

Here is a simple snapshot of analytics dashboard wireframing, made with the participation of key team members which at the end was fully approved by every team member.
