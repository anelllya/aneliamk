It came with a lot of cool stuff, such as components states, real time collaboration, and more. I\u2019ve been using this software for a little less than a year and I have to say, it has changed a lot in the last few months. They have developed a lot of functionalities, keep it up Adobe. Although, it had this major update a lot is still missing, I am sure it will come soon.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/large-prototypes-adobe-xd/#prototype-that-is-constantly-growing","title":"Prototype that is constantly growing","text":"<p>At work, our team is developing a complicated platform, it includes more than a hundred screens and interactions between them. We used to have it all in only one file because it\u2019s what you would expect. As the number of artboards and interactions grew, we needed to do something about it because the software was getting slow. This is how the first file separation in major sections happened. And here is the feature I am missing \u2013 External Links to link our other files and simulate navigation through the whole platform.</p> <p>Then, we realised that working in agile and continuous development cannot go on overwriting the prototype as we go. It provokes conflict with stakeholders and the development team. We needed to close a prototype version with the same pace as our releases. Each one of those files needed to be available for search, allowing us to consult changes and when were they applied. This is exactly how it gets a little bit tricky. We could have the files in Creative Cloud but uploading and updating those big files also got slow.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/large-prototypes-adobe-xd/#version-control","title":"Version control","text":"<p>Another downside was that nobody has the version control over the files and things appear and disappear without leaving a trace. We decided we should go old school, using git, and putting a message with each commit. The most important thing when you develop a modern app is that you are not limited to only one type of 12 grids. (BOOOM!). You can have different grids throughout your design and they don\u2019t need to match (mind blowing, I know). These grids do not come specified in the shared for development prototype, yet. The solution, developers download the files and consult the grids that are used in each section.</p> <p>This is still a workaround and seems complicated at first, so I hope it changes and adapts better to continuous development.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/large-prototypes-adobe-xd/#some-unexpected-changes","title":"Some unexpected changes","text":"<p>When the new update was released this November, the first day I was puzzled: \u201cOhhh\u2026? Ahhh\u2026? Where is my Share button?\u201d It moved from the top right corner to the top left one, so it took me some time to adapt. It looks like a small change, but it is about a functionality you are using everyday and let\u2019s face it, the first couple of days it\u2019s tough.</p> <p>I am usually excited about the new stuff, so this was no different. One of the coolest things they presented was Components states \u2013 simulation of buttons states \u2013 normal, on hover, pressed, expanded, those are the basic ones. This also meant that we needed to remake a lot of stuff. Obviously we had already made navigation menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, search areas, etc\u2026 the old way. But this new thing meant that we could reduce the number of Artboards and actually present more realistic results. So we got on to it.</p> <p>Now, we have our main platform separated by main sections with its primary, secondary and tertiary buttons, checkboxes, toggles and radio buttons all clickable from the prototype: \u201cYey!\u201d I must say they are all shared and it looks very cool, but I would really like to be able to have the whole prototype in the same file. I don\u2019t know what number is the limit for artboards, but I know we have outgrown it very fast.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/large-prototypes-adobe-xd/#website-prototype","title":"Website prototype","text":"<p>We needed to prepare a website prototype for a client applying all the different capabilities we have developed so far. Taking into account each one of the included functionalities, each layout change, everything. Here we are developing this prototype for approval and it is getting cra-aa-zy again.</p> <p>We are already 36 artboard designs in. It includes six different resolutions, light and dark modes, and of course, designs for different sections which multiplies by six resolutions and it grows and grows. We try to maintain everything nice and organized, but with this many considerations, it is insane.</p> <p>I remember my first website prototype back in 2009, it had 5 main pages, no CMS behind and only one resolution and only one mode. We did designs for a homepage and three or four main pages, including special services and featured elements. In total, it was like 5 screens and we were good to go.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/large-prototypes-adobe-xd/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>Here we are now, it\u2019s so overwhelming. Sure the tools and computers have become a lot better, it\u2019s faster than ever to develop something cool, but come on?!</p> <p>The most frustrating thing of all this is that all I mentioned above is necessary, so everybody stays on the same page of what\u2019s being developed. It is great for your client, to see what you are actually talking about. Also for the development team to know exactly what everybody is expecting with little amount of extra information. And here we are, keeping it all connected and trying to develop the next best product. </p> <p>A lot of artboards, powerful tools and a lot to keep track of, when somebody asks for changes. I will keep applying all the new stuff as I always do, because it is important to stay up to date.

I have been longing to get to it and I finally did.</p> <p>There were a couple of things I had to get used to at my new position. The first and very important, integrate in a development team that has not had a designer for a very long time. I had to learn a lot about the project we are developing, who is doing what, who to talk to when I have a specific question, etc\u2026</p> <p>When people go to work in an office, there usually is no habit of documenting everything, every decision that was taken, reasons why, etc \u2026 and this place was no different. There was some documentation, but it was definitely not enough for me to understand it all.</p> <p>I decided to stay patient (everybody that knows me, knows that this is the hardest part), but eventually, I got used to the process, morning stand ups, retrospectives, sprint planifications and everything else. Although, this was all new for me, from the experience I previously had, I felt like in my own waters there.</p> <p>A couple of months later when I felt that I knew my way around and got a little more confident in my new position, I made the first request for Work From Home in the company\u2019s calendar. I got almost an immediate response: \u201cOK\u201d. I said: \u201cWait a minute, is that all that it takes? I will definitely do it again.\u201d After that he day came and I took my laptop, connected my home screen to it and started working from my home desk.</p> <p>Well, I don\u2019t really remember what I did that day, but I remember the feeling of a dream just getting a big fat green checkmark.</p> <p>You see, around four years ago, I was working on a project of developing a base theme for twelve different websites, using a local server for development and another one for production. The themes had the same base structure, but had some differences, so all of this had to be managed, developed and maintained and I had the best document ever to guide me how to do it. Everything that was changed manually and to watch for when updates were coming and so on. I got a little carried away here, but my point is, around this time, I started thinking that something basic is wrong there and after a little while I came to the conclusion that what I was actually doing was crossing half an island (60km back and forth) to go to the office and connect to a server, maintain myself busy and then get on a car again, and head home. Around that time, I had a little boy, he was a little over 2 years old, and it was very interesting seeing him discovering simple things. So, I made a simple count and the two hours I am spending on the road everyday are taking ten hours per week from me seeing this little boy growing.</p> <p>Well, nothing is that simple, but the fact is, there is no sense of me being present in an office, if I am going to be much happier staying a couple of days a week and work from home. It saves energy in the morning, saves gasoline and, frankly, two hours of my day. It made me look for opportunities, but again around 2015, there were some remote companies, but nothing like what we have nowadays. There a couple of sites where you can go to, register and start experiencing on your own, see if you actually like it. There was nothing there when I started thinking about it. There were some lucky people posting how cool it is to work remotely and don\u2019t depend on a physical environment. I don\u2019t remember exactly when, but sure enough, Automattic closed their office and it got a lot of press around the world, I remember thinking to myself that day: \u201cjust how lucky these people are!\u201d. I went on doing my job, crossing the island and waiting for something new and interesting to appear. Well, it\u2019s been some time, but it is actually happening now.</p> <p>Remote work is way more attractive for me and I hope more companies will realise that and help their people stay happier and more productive, enjoying the work and their lives.</p> <p>I am very grateful for my current position, where I can ask for a remote day and just get it. It comes very helpful when my son has a cold and need to stay around to give him medicine. Although, he is not so little now, I still enjoy his presence a lot and I am very happy to have him around while I am actually at work, resolving my everyday jira tasks.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/podcasts-i-listen/","title":"Podcasts to listen","text":"<p>This year has definitely been discovering podcasts for me.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/podcasts-i-listen/#in-spanish","title":"In Spanish","text":"<p>One of my favourite podcasts in the whole world is \u201cEntiende tu mente\u201d (Understand your mind). It\u2019s been a long time since the first episode I listened, and I have never stopped. In this podcast, there are three main figures, one coach \u2013 Monica Gonzales, one psychotherapist \u2013 Luis Mui\u00f1o and a former radio spokesmam \u2013 Molo Cebrian. The trio talks about mental difficulties and how to deal with different situations. I love it, because no matter how I am feeling the day I listen to an episode, my mood changes in just 20 minutes.</p> <p>I discovered it one day when I was feeling particularly down and started searching for information in the internet. I stumbled upon a podcast stating \u201c20 minutes to understand yourself better\u201d. I gave it a try and I actually felt better, so I continued listening. The thing is, no matter what \u201chole\u201d is in front of me, when they talk about serious problems and situations that people deal with, I get that feeling inside: \u201cThank god I am alive and actually fine!\u201d</p> <p>Another podcast that worths listening to in Spanish is \u201cEl arte de presentar\u201c. Although, it\u2019s been almost a year since the last episode, if you haven\u2019t listened to this podcast you definitely should. They speak about presentations, how to sound confident and provide value to your audience at scale. I am sure there are a lot of people that are doing this kind of thing, but Gonzalo really walks the talk and it\u2019s a pleasure to listen to him and his interviews.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/11/podcasts-i-listen/#in-english","title":"In English","text":"<p>Well, since there has always been more content in English than any other language over the internet. It is normal that this list has more examples.</p> <p>Lately, I find myslef listening to mainly four podcasts. One of them is Scriptnotes it is a podcast for screenwriters and things that are intersting to screenwriters. Well, I am not a writer, not even close to being one, but I do enjoy when John August and Craig Maizin speak their truth about very diverse topics. I also think that going out of my industry is actually beneficial to keep an open mind.</p> <p>At work and in my personal life, I have been struggling with task organization and keeping things planned and thought out. Then, one day I found a podcast by a very famous author right on topic \u2013 Getting things done (of course). It has served me well to start applying concepts from David Allen\u2019s book and to understand better problems that come with the lack of organization. I hope, I am getting better at it, but it will take time to master.</p> <p>Another topic that is very dear to me is working remotely, or in distance or in distributed environments, whatever term you like. There is one podcast about things that happen to people that are working far away from one another and do not have an office. It is called Distributed by Matt Mullenweg. Since Automattic is 100% distributed, they have been dealing with those issues for a very long time. I find it important to listen to people that actually have the experience.</p> <p>I tend to have troubles with sleeping. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and going back to sleep is very difficult. Another search result brought me to Tracks to relax. Since the first episode of sleeping meditation I listened, the meditations have worked like a charm every single night.</p> <p>This is my current list of podcasts and reasons I find them interesting. Let me know if you agree or not with it.</p>"},{"location":"work/","title":"Work","text":""},{"location":"work/branding/","title":"Branding","text":""},{"location":"work/content-design/pecas/","title":"PECA'S Tenerfie","text":""},{"location":"work/digital-products/system73/","title":"Online Video Platform - KUNO","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2019/","title":"2019","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/adobe-xd/","title":"Adobe Xd","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/ui-prototypes/","title":"UI Prototypes","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/personal/","title":"Personal","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/podcast-list/","title":"Podcast list","text":""}]}
